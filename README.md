### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Ale MuÃ±oz, a digital toolsmith who loves building things that help people do more with less work (i.e: I'm a Good Lazyâ„¢).

I work for [Sketch](https://sketch.com), but you may have used some of the stuff I've created over the years (especially if you've written ActionScript or used Adobe Fireworks).

Feel free to reach out to talk about anything related to design tools, working less, or both. Alternatively, you can literally [ask me anything](https://github.com/bomberstudios/ama).
